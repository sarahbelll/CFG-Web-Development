 CFG Web Development - Project

Code First Girls Web Development Intensive Course project: a collaboration between Sarah Bell, Abigail Elms and Immy Sutton. We created an interactive website about the Solar System, which displays facts and images. The website is also responsive to all screen widths and devices. We received the Highly Commended certificate upon completing the course which is awarded to the team with the best website as decided by the course instructors.
